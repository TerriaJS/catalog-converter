# 1. Share conversion assumptions

Date: 2020-10-12

## Status

PR - https://github.com/TerriaJS/catalog-converter/pull/11

## Context

V7 share structure is quite different from v8 and there doesn't seem to be a clear way to convert properties (especially `id`s)

## Decision

### Manually set IDs

These are copied across in `convertMember`

### Autogenerated IDs

- v7 ID has format `/Root Group/$someContainerId/$someLowerContainerId/$catalogName`
- v8 ID has format `//$someContainerId/$someLowerContainerId/$catalogName`
- So replace "Root Group" with "/"

**Note** these aren't written to the `id` catalog member property, they are used as keys in the model JSON

#### User added items (first level items)

- v7 ID has format `/Root Group/User-Added Data/$catalogName`
- v8 ID has format `/$catalogName` (Not double slash)
- So remove `/Root Group/User-Added Data`

##### Nested user added items

For example WMS groups - which aren't currently supported.

**All ids are deleted** so v8 will guess

### Known container IDs

Generated from `parents` property similar to IDs above, but:

- For user added data - use `__User-Added_Data__`
- For Root Group items - use `/`

### Unchanged Share properties

These are just copied across

- `initialCamera`
- `homeCamera`
- `baseMapName`
- `viewerMode`
- `currentTime`
- `showSplitter`
- `splitPosition`
- `previewedItemId`

### String init sources (eg URLs)

These are just copied across, so conversion must be handled client-side

### User added data

In v7 user added data is added to the `catalog` property. I am assuming that everything is contained (and correct) in the `Root Group/User-Added Data` catalog group (i.e. all user added data is in the `items` of the catalog group) - I ignore user added data models which are in `sharedCatalogMembers`.

Because otherwise - if a user-added item is shared in the workbench, it results in duplicate model across v7 `catalog` and `sharedCatalogMembers` - eg https://github.com/TerriaJS/catalog-converter/pull/11#issuecomment-693348213

## Consequences

May need tweaking as we add more catalog items, more share properties or when we add `shareKeys` to v8 (to keep track of IDs across different versions)
